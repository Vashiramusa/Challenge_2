<p>adidas has its roots in Germany but we are a truly global company. Around the world we employ over 57,000 people.
   Employees from about 100 nations are working at our global HQ in Herzogenaurach, Germany – the ‘World of Sports’.
   Every year we produce over 900 million sports and sports lifestyle products with independent manufacturing partners worldwide.
   In 2018 we generated sales of € 21.915 billion. These numbers alone can easily suggest that adidas is quite a large and also
   multifaceted organization. True. But we keep things simple, lean and fast. And we will use this approach now to give an overview
   of what our company is all about.
<br><br>
adidas value feedback from our stakeholders about our program and we appreciate positive recognition from international institutions
and rating agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and socially responsible investment (SRI) analysts. These organizations evaluate
our work through in-depth analysis of the company’s environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) programs, including document review
and interviews with employees and management. The following awards demonstrate external recognition and acknowledgement of adidas' initiativesworldwide.


<br><br>
The adidas brand has a long history and deep-rooted connection with sport. Everything we do is rooted in sport. This is what ‘The Badge of Sport’ stands
for as a brand mark. Our broad and diverse sports portfolio, from major global sports such as football and running, to regional heartbeat sports such as
American football and rugby, has enabled the brand to transcend cultures and become one of the most recognized and iconic global brands, on and off the field of play.
The adidas brand’s mission is to be the best sports brand in the world, by designing, building and selling the best sports products in the world, with the best service and experience.
